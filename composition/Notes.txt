🔥 ASSOCIATION vs AGGREGATION vs COMPOSITION (FULL CLEAR)
🧠 First: ONE SIMPLE IDEA

All three are HAS-A relationships
The difference is OBJECT LIFECYCLE & OWNERSHIP

1️⃣ ASSOCIATION (USES-A)
🟢 Definition (Simple)

Two classes are related, but independent.
“One object uses another object”

🧠 Real-Life Example

👨‍🏫 Teacher — Student

Teacher exists without student
Student exists without teacher
Just interaction

✅ Java Example
class Teacher {
    String name;

    Teacher(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Student {
    void study(Teacher teacher) {
        System.out.println("Studying from " + teacher.name);
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Teacher t = new Teacher("Ravi");
        Student s = new Student();
        s.study(t);
    }
}

🔑 Key Points

✔ No ownership
✔ Objects are independent
✔ No object created inside another

2️⃣ AGGREGATION (HAS-A – Weak)
🟢 Definition

Child object is part of parent, but can live independently.
“Parent has a child, but child is not destroyed with parent”

🧠 Real-Life Example

🏫 Department — Employee
Department exists without employee
Employee exists without department

✅ Java Example
class Department {
    String name;

    Department(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Employee {
    Department dept;

    Employee(Department dept) {   // passed from outside
        this.dept = dept;
    }

    void show() {
        System.out.println("Department: " + dept.name);
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Department d = new Department("IT");
        Employee e = new Employee(d);
        e.show();
    }
}

🔑 Key Points

✔ Weak ownership
✔ Object passed via constructor
✔ Loose coupling

3️⃣ COMPOSITION (HAS-A – Strong)
🟢 Definition

Child object cannot exist without parent.
“If parent dies, child dies”

🧠 Real-Life Example

🚗 Car — Engine
No engine → no car
Engine created inside car

✅ Java Example
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // created inside

    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car moving");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.drive();
    }
}

🔑 Key Points

✔ Strong ownership
✔ Child created inside parent
✔ Tight coupling

🔥 FINAL COMPARISON TABLE (MEMORIZE THIS)

Feature	                Association	    Aggregation	    Composition

Relationship	           Uses-A	    Has-A (Weak)	Has-A (Strong)
Ownership	               ❌ No	        ⚠️ Partial	    ✅ Full
Lifecycle dependency	   ❌ No	           ❌ No	        ✅ Yes
Object creation	          Outside	        Outside	        Inside
Coupling	                Loose	        Loose	        Tight
Real-world usage	    Interaction	        Modeling	Core structure

🧠 SUPER INTERVIEW RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)

👉 Just reference? → Association
👉 Passed from outside? → Aggregation
👉 Created inside? → Composition

🔥 QUICK CHECK (Answer mentally)

class A {
    B b;
}

✔ Association

class A {
    A(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

✔ Aggregation

class A {
    B b = new B();
}

✔ Composition
