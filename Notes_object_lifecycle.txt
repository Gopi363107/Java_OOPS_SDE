🔵 OBJECT LIFECYCLE IN JAVA (COMPLETE)

Think of an object’s life like a human life 👶 → 🧑 → 🪦

1️⃣ Class Loading (Before Object Exists)

Before any object is created:

JVM loads the class

Static members are loaded once

class Test {
    static int x = 10;
}


📌 Happens only once, no matter how many objects you create.

2️⃣ Object Creation (Birth of Object) 👶
How object is created?

Using new keyword

Student s = new Student();


What happens internally:

Memory allocated in Heap

Default values assigned

Constructor executed

Reference stored in Stack

3️⃣ Memory Allocation (VERY IMPORTANT FOR INTERVIEWS)
🧠 Memory Areas Involved
Part	Stores
Stack	Reference (s)
Heap	Actual Object
Method Area	Class, static data
Example:
Student s = new Student();

Stack        Heap
------       ------
s  ----->   Student object


📌 Objects always live in HEAP

4️⃣ Initialization
Default Initialization
int x;        // 0
String name; // null

Constructor Initialization
Student(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}


Constructor sets real values.

5️⃣ Object Usage (Alive State) 🧑

Object is alive as long as:

It has at least one reference

Student s1 = new Student();
Student s2 = s1;   // two references


📌 Object is NOT destroyed if any reference exists

6️⃣ Reference Removal (Becoming Eligible for GC) ⚠️

Object becomes eligible for Garbage Collection when:

Case 1: Reference set to null
s = null;

Case 2: Reassigned reference
s = new Student();

Case 3: Method local object
void create() {
    Student s = new Student();
} // s goes out of scope


📌 Eligible ≠ Collected immediately

7️⃣ Garbage Collection (Death) 🪦

JVM automatically destroys objects

Programmer cannot force GC

System.gc(); // only request, not guarantee

Garbage Collector:

Runs in background

Removes unused objects

Frees Heap memory

8️⃣ finalize() Method (OLD – Interview Concept)
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("Object destroyed");
}


📌 Called before GC
📌 Not reliable
📌 Deprecated in Java 9+

👉 Never use in real projects

9️⃣ Modern Object Cleanup (BEST PRACTICE) ✅

Instead of finalize():

Use try-with-resources

Close resources manually

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("a.txt")) {
}
