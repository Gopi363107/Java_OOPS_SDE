First: What does static mean?

👉 static means “belongs(property or member) to the class, not to objects.”

Non-static → belongs to each object

Static → shared by all objects of that class

1️⃣ Static Variable (Class Variable)
Normal variable (non-static)

Each object gets its own copy.

Static variable

Only ONE copy, shared by all objects.

Example
class Student {
    String name;          // instance variable
    static String college; // static variable
}

Think like this:

name → different for each student

college → same for all students

Usage
Student.college = "ABC College";

Student s1 = new Student();
Student s2 = new Student();

s1.name = "Rahul";
s2.name = "Amit";


➡️ Both students share the same college value

Real-life example

Bus company name → same for all buses (static)

Bus number → different for each bus (non-static)

2️⃣ Static Method
What is it?

A method that belongs to the class, not objects.

Example
class MathUtils {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

Calling static method
int sum = MathUtils.add(5, 3);


✔️ No object needed

Important Rules

Static methods cannot use non-static variables directly

Static methods cannot use this keyword

Why?

Because static method runs without creating any object

3️⃣ Static Block
What is it?

A block of code that runs ONLY ONCE, when the class is loaded.

Example
class Test {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
    }
}

Output
Static block executed

When is it used?

Database connection

Loading drivers

Initializing static variables

Important:

✔️ Runs before main()
✔️ Runs only once

4️⃣ Static Class (Important Concept)
Can we have a static class?

🚫 Top-level classes cannot be static

✔️ Inner classes can be static

Example
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Static inner class");
        }
    }
}

Why static inner class?

Does not need Outer class object

Used to group helper classes

Usage
Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();
obj.show();

Quick Summary Table

One-Line Definition

Static members are shared and belong to the class, not individual objects.
