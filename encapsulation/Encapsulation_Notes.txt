✅ 1. What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation = Wrapping data (variables) and methods together + hiding data

In simple words:

Protect your data from outside misuse

Real-world example:

Bank ATM

You cannot directly access balance

You use deposit() / withdraw() methods

That is encapsulation.

✅ 2. How Encapsulation is Achieved in Java?

Using:

private variables

public getters & setters

❌ Without Encapsulation (Bad Practice)
class Employee {
    public double salary;
}


Anyone can do:

emp.salary = -50000; // ❌ wrong

✅ With Encapsulation (Correct Practice)
class Employee {

    private double salary;  // data hiding

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        if (salary > 0) {
            this.salary = salary;
        }
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}


Now:

Salary cannot be negative

Data is protected

Logic is controlled

🔑 3. Why Encapsulation is IMPORTANT for MNCs?

Interviewers expect:

Security

Maintainability

Controlled access

Loose coupling

Encapsulation gives all of this.

⭐ 4. Getters and Setters Explained
Getter → read data
Setter → modify data
Syntax pattern (must remember):
public datatype getVariableName() {
    return variableName;
}

public void setVariableName(datatype value) {
    this.variableName = value;
}

⭐ 5. Example (BankAccount with Encapsulation)
class BankAccount {

    private String name;
    private double balance;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}


✔ Notice:

balance is private

No direct access

Business rules enforced

🔥 6. Encapsulation vs Abstraction (INTERVIEW QUESTION)

Feature	            Encapsulation	                        Abstraction

Focus	            Data protection	                    Hiding implementation
How	            private + getters/setters	           abstract class / interface
Level	            Implementation	                            Design

❓ 7. Common Interview Questions

Q1. Is encapsulation mandatory in Java?

❌ No, but best practice.

Q2. Can encapsulation exist without getters/setters?

✔ Yes (methods like deposit/withdraw also encapsulate logic).

Q3. Is encapsulation related to inheritance?

❌ No, it is independent.

🧠 8. You already USED Encapsulation!

Your previous codes:

private variables

public methods

controlled acces

🧠 Interview Questions You Can Answer Now
❓ What is encapsulation?

Wrapping data and methods together and restricting direct access using private variables and controlled access through methods.

❓ Why use getters & setters?

To control access, apply validation, and protect internal object state.

❓ Is encapsulation only getters/setters?

No. Any controlled access method like deposit() or withdraw() also provides encapsulation.
