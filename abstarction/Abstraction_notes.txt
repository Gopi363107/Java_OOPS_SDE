✅ 1. What is Abstraction?

Abstraction = Hiding implementation details and showing only what is necessary

Simple definition:
What an object does is shown, how it does is hidden.

🌍 Real-World Example

ATM Machine

-You see → withdraw(), deposit(), checkBalance()
-You don’t see → bank server logic, encryption, database code
That is abstraction.

✅ 2. How Abstraction is Achieved in Java?

Java provides two ways:

 - Abstract Class
 - Interface

🔹 3. What is an Abstract Class?

An abstract class:

~Can have abstract methods (without body)
~Can have concrete methods (with body)
~Cannot be instantiated (no object creation)

Syntax
abstract class ClassName {
    abstract void method1(); // no body
    void method2() { }        // with body
}
