🔥 final KEYWORD IN JAVA (FROM ZERO → INTERVIEW TRAPS)

The final keyword is used to RESTRICT something.

It can be applied to:
1️⃣ Variable
2️⃣ Method
3️⃣ Class

1️⃣ final VARIABLE
🔹 Meaning:

Once assigned, value cannot be changed

Example:
class Test {
    final int x = 10;

    void show() {
        // x = 20;  ❌ ERROR
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}

🔹 final with reference variables
final int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
arr[0] = 100;   // ✅ allowed
// arr = new int[]{4,5}; ❌ NOT allowed


📌 Value inside object can change, reference cannot

2️⃣ final METHOD
🔹 Meaning:

Method cannot be overridden

Example:
class Parent {
    final void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent show");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // void show() {} ❌ ERROR
}


📌 Used for security & performance

3️⃣ final CLASS
🔹 Meaning:

Class cannot be inherited

Example:
final class Vehicle {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Running");
    }
}

// class Car extends Vehicle {} ❌ ERROR


📌 Example: String, Math, Integer

4️⃣ VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW TABLE

Usage	            Can change?	    Can inherit?	Can override?
final variable	       ❌ No            	—	            —
final method	        —	            ✅ Yes	      ❌ No
final class         	—	            ❌ No	      ❌ No

5️⃣ COMMON INTERVIEW TRAPS ⚠️

❓ Can constructor be final?
👉 ❌ NO
Because constructors are not inherited

❓ Can abstract method be final?
👉 ❌ NO
Abstract → must override
Final → cannot override
❌ Contradiction

❓ Can we overload final methods?
👉 ✅ YES
Overloading ≠ overriding

6️⃣ REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE (BEST ANSWER)

Like a PAN number or Aadhaar number → once assigned, cannot change → final

🧪 PRACTICE TASK (IMPORTANT)
/* Create a final class Bank
   with final variable IFSC_CODE
   and final method displayIFSC()
   Try inheriting it and observe error */

🧠 One-Line Interview Answers (VERY IMPORTANT)
❓ Why make a class final?

To prevent inheritance for security or design reasons.

❓ Why String class is final?

To avoid modification of immutable data and ensure security.

❓ Can final method be overloaded?

✅ Yes, because overloading is compile-time.
